--make sure the order of the values is in the same order as the columns in the table.
--Here, the INSERT INTO syntax would be as follows:

--What is a Stored Procedure?
--A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, 
--so the code can be reused over and over again.

--So if you have an SQL query that you write over and over again, 
--save it as a stored procedure, and then just call it to execute it.

--You can also pass parameters to a stored procedure, so that the stored
--procedure can act based on the parameter value(s) that is passed.

--Stored Procedure Syntax

--CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name
--AS
--sql_statement
--GO;

--Execute a Stored Procedure
--EXEC procedure_name;

--SQL Comments
--Single Line Comments
--Single line comments start with --.
--Any text between -- and the end of the line will be ignored (will not be executed).

--/*Multi-line Comments
--Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.
--Any text between /* and */ will be ignored.
--The following example uses a multi-line comment as an explanation:

-- SQL Operator 
-- W3SCHOOL Link -- https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_operators.asp

--Types of SQL Operators
--We have various SQL operators, and they are as follows:

--SQL Arithmetic operators
--SQL Comparison operators
--SQL Logical operators
--SQL Compound Operators
--SQL Bitwise Operators
--SQL Unary Operator

--SQL Arithmetic Operators

--Operator	Description	
--+			Add	
---			Subtract	
--*			Multiply	
--/			Divide	
--%			Modulo

-- Example
select 30+10 -- 40     
select 2*3 -- 6
select 25-3 -- 22
select 29/3-- 9
select 20%3 --2


--SQL Bitwise Operators -- need to study in detail

--Operator	Description
--&			Bitwise AND
--|			Bitwise OR
--^			Bitwise exclusive OR

--Example
select 10 & 20 -- 0
select 10 | 20 -- 30
select 10 ^ 20 -- 30

select 10 & 10 -- 10
select 10 | 20 -- 30
select 10 ^ 20 -- 30

--How does bitwise & operator work?
--Remarks. The bitwise AND operator ( & ) compares each bit of the first operand to the 
--corresponding bit of the second operand. If both bits are 1, the corresponding result
--bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.

--SQL Comparison Operators
--Operator		Description	
--1	=				Equal to	
--2	>				Greater than	
--3	<				Less than	
--4	>=				Greater than or equal to	
--5	<=				Less than or equal to	
--6	<>				Not equal to
--7	!<				Not less than
--8	!=				Not Equal to
--9	! >				Not greater than


--Example

select * from product where UnitsInStock > 20 
select * from product where UnitsInStock < 20 
select * from product where UnitsInStock >= 20 
select * from product where UnitsInStock <= 20 
select * from product where UnitsInStock = 11 
select * from product where UnitsInStock <> 20 


--SQL Compound Operators

--Operator			Description
--	+=						Add equals
--	-=						Subtract equals
--	*=						Multiply equals
--	/=						Divide equals
--	%=						Modulo equals
--	&=						Bitwise AND equals
--	^-=						Bitwise exclusive equals
--	|*=						Bitwise OR equals


--Compound operators execute some operation and set an original value to the result of the operation.
--For example, if a variable @x equals 35, then @x += 2 takes the original value of @x, 
--add 2 and sets @x to that new value (37). Adds some amount to the original value and 
--sets the original value to the result.

declare @a int 
declare @b int =10

select (UnitsInStock+=10)  from Product

select UnitsInStock from product

--SQL Logical Operators
--	  Operator				Description	
--1		ALL						TRUE if all of the subquery values meet the condition	
--2		AND						TRUE if all the conditions separated by AND is TRUE	
--3		ANY						TRUE if any of the subquery values meet the condition	
--4		BETWEEN					TRUE if the operand is within the range of comparisons	
--5		EXISTS					TRUE if the subquery returns one or more records	
--6		IN						TRUE if the operand is equal to one of a list of expressions	
--7		LIKE					TRUE if the operand matches a pattern	
--8		NOT						Displays a record if the condition(s) is NOT TRUE	
--9		OR						TRUE if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE	
--10	SOME					TRUE if any of the subquery values meet the condition

--SQL Database

--create database databasename
--create database testDB
--drop database testDB


--The SQL BACKUP DATABASE Statement
--The BACKUP DATABASE statement is used in SQL Server 
--to create a full back up of an existing SQL database.

--Syntax
BACKUP DATABASE databasename
TO DISK = 'filepath';


--The SQL BACKUP WITH DIFFERENTIAL Statement
--A differential back up only backs up the parts of the database
--that have changed since the last full database backup.

--Syntax
BACKUP DATABASE databasename
TO DISK = 'filepath'
WITH DIFFERENTIAL;


--BACKUP DATABASE Example
--The following SQL statement creates a full back up of the 
--existing database "testDB" to the D disk:

--Example
BACKUP DATABASE testDB
TO DISK = 'D:\backups\testDB.bak';

backup database  W3_SCHOOL
to disk = 'C:\DatabaseBackup\W3_SCHOOL.bak'


--BACKUP WITH DIFFERENTIAL Example
--The following SQL statement creates a differential back up of the database "testDB":

--Example
BACKUP DATABASE testDB
TO DISK = 'D:\backups\testDB.bak'
WITH DIFFERENTIAL;
--Tip: A differential back up reduces the back up time (since only the changes are backed up).\

--The SQL DROP TABLE Statement
--The DROP TABLE statement is used to drop an existing table in a database.

drop table persons

select * from persons

--SQL TRUNCATE TABLE
--The TRUNCATE TABLE statement is used to delete the data inside a table, but not the table itself.

truncate table persons

--SQL ALTER TABLE Statement

--The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table.
--The ALTER TABLE statement is also used to add and drop various constraints on an existing table.

--ALTER TABLE - ADD Column
--To add a column in a table, use the following syntax:

--ALTER TABLE table_name
--ADD column_name datatype;

ALTER TABLE persons
ADD Pincode varchar(100)  default text '228119'

alter table persons add email varchar(100)

select * from persons


--ALTER TABLE - DROP COLUMN
--To delete a column in a table, use the following syntax (notice that some database systems don't allow deleting a column):

--ALTER TABLE table_name
--DROP COLUMN column_name;


alter table persons
drop column email

alter table persons drop column country

--ALTER TABLE - RENAME COLUMN
--To rename a column in a table, use the following syntax:

--ALTER TABLE table_name
--RENAME COLUMN old_name to new_name;

alter table persons
rename column PersonID to Id

--ALTER TABLE - ALTER/MODIFY DATATYPE
--To change the data type of a column in a table, use the following syntax:

--SQL Server / MS Access:

--ALTER TABLE table_name
--ALTER COLUMN column_name datatype;

alter table Persons
alter column FirstName int

alter table Persons
alter column Pincode varchar(100)

alter table persons
drop column Country

insert into  Persons(Pincode)values('Fa1232')

select * from  Persons

alter table Persons
drop column Birthday


--alter table Persons
--alter column  Birthday year -- not valid in SQL may be

--date type take date in MDY format and returns in YMD

alter table persons

--SQL Constraints

--SQL Create Constraints
--Constraints can be specified when the table is created with the CREATE TABLE statement,
--or after the table is created with the ALTER TABLE statement.

--CREATE TABLE table_name (
--    column1 datatype constraint,
--    column2 datatype constraint,
--    column3 datatype constraint,
--    ....
--);


--Constraints can be column level or table level. Column level constraints apply to a column, 
--and table level constraints apply to the whole table.

--NOT NULL			- Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value
--UNIQUE			- Ensures that all values in a column are different
--PRIMARY KEY		- A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each row in a table
--FOREIGN KEY		- Prevents actions that would destroy links between tables
--CHECK				- Ensures that the values in a column satisfies a specific condition
--DEFAULT			- Sets a default value for a column if no value is specified
--CREATE INDEX		- Used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly


create table ConstraintsCheck
(
id int primary key identity,
name varchar(100) not null,
Country varchar(100) unique,
status int default 0,
)


insert into ConstraintsCheck(name,country) values('Fahad Ali','Pakistan')

insert into ConstraintsCheck(name,country) values('','UAE')
insert into ConstraintsCheck(name,country) values('','Kuwait')

    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    Age int
)


insert into Student(lastName,FirstName)values('Ali','Fahad')

insert into Student(lastName,FirstName)values('Ali','Fahad')
insert into Student(lastName,FirstName,Age)values('Siddiqui','Hamza',23)


select * from Student

--SQL NOT NULL on ALTER TABLE
--To create a NOT NULL constraint on the "Age" column when the "Persons" table is already created, use the following SQL:

--SQL Server / MS Access:

--ALTER TABLE Persons
--ALTER COLUMN Age int NOT NULL;

Alter table Student
alter column age int not null

delete from Student where id =1

--SQL UNIQUE Constraint
--The UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are different.

--Both the UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY constraints provide a guarantee for uniqueness 
--for a column or set of columns.

--A PRIMARY KEY constraint automatically has a UNIQUE constraint.
--However, you can have many UNIQUE constraints per table, but only 
--one PRIMARY KEY constraint per table.


--To name a UNIQUE constraint, and to define a UNIQUE constraint on multiple 
--columns, use the following SQL syntax:

CREATE TABLE Employeerec (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    CONSTRAINT UC_Person UNIQUE (ID,LastName)

--To name a UNIQUE constraint, and to define a UNIQUE constraint on multiple columns,
--use the following SQL syntax:

--MySQL / SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:

--ALTER TABLE Persons
--ADD CONSTRAINT UC_Person UNIQUE (ID,LastName);

--UC_Person   is a name of unique Constarints

--DROP a UNIQUE Constraint
--To drop a UNIQUE constraint, use the following SQL:

--MySQL:

--ALTER TABLE Persons
--DROP INDEX UC_Person;

--alter table Library
--drop index UK_Library -- The operation 'ALTER TABLE DROP INDEX' is supported only with memory optimized tables.

--SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:

--ALTER TABLE Persons
--DROP CONSTRAINT UC_Person;

alter table Library
drop CONSTRAINT UK_Library  -- remove constrains from whole column

--SQL PRIMARY KEY Constraint
--The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table.

--Primary keys must contain UNIQUE values, and cannot contain NULL values.

--A table can have only ONE primary key; and in the table, this primary key can 
--consist of single or multiple columns (fields).

select * from CompanyX

insert into CompanyX(id,lastname,age)values(2,'Ali',23)
insert into CompanyX(id,lastname,age)values(2,'fahad',23)

--SQL PRIMARY KEY on ALTER TABLE
--To create a PRIMARY KEY constraint on the "ID" column when the table is already created, use the following SQL:

--MySQL / SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:

--ALTER TABLE Persons
--ADD PRIMARY KEY (ID);


create table tbPrimary(
id int ,
name varchar(100),
age int
)
alter table tbPrimary
add primary key (id)

alter table tbprimary
alter column id int not null

--Note: If you use ALTER TABLE to add a primary key, the primary key column(s) 
--must have been declared to not contain NULL values (when the table was first created).

--DROP a PRIMARY KEY Constraint
--To drop a PRIMARY KEY constraint, use the following SQL:

ALTER TABLE Persons
DROP CONSTRAINT PK_Person;

alter table CompanyX
drop constraint pk_CompanyX  -- iske liye hamare pass constraint ka name hona chaiyre nahi to possible nahi hai

--SQL FOREIGN KEY Constraint
--The FOREIGN KEY constraint is used to prevent actions that would destroy links between tables.

--A FOREIGN KEY is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table.

--The table with the foreign key is called the child table, and the table with the primary key is called the referenced or parent table.


--SQL FOREIGN KEY on CREATE TABLE
--The following SQL creates a FOREIGN KEY on the "PersonID" column when the "Orders" table is created:

CREATE TABLE Orders (

--SQL CREATE INDEX Statement
--The CREATE INDEX statement is used to create indexes in tables.

--Indexes are used to retrieve data from the database more quickly than otherwise. 
--The users cannot see the indexes, they are just used to speed up searches/queries.


--Note: Updating a table with indexes takes more time than updating a table without (because the indexes also need an update). So, only create indexes on columns that will be frequently searched against.

--CREATE INDEX Syntax
--Creates an index on a table. Duplicate values are allowed:

--CREATE INDEX index_name
--ON table_name (column1, column2, ...);


CREATE INDEX idx_lastname
ON Persons (LastName);

create index idx_name
on Persons (LastName)

create unique index idx_unqindex
on Persons (FirstName)

create index idx_PriceQuanty
on Product(Price,Quantity)

select  Price,Quantity from Product where pid =6

--DROP INDEX Statement

DROP INDEX table_name.index_name;

drop index Product.idx_PriceQuanty

--SQL AUTO INCREMENT Field

--AUTO INCREMENT Field
--Auto-increment allows a unique number to be generated automatically when a new record is inserted into a table.

--Often this is the primary key field that we would like to be created automatically every time a new record is inserted.

CREATE TABLE Persons_1 (
    Personid int IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int
);

--Tip: To specify that the "Personid" column should start at value 10 and increment by 5, 
--change it to IDENTITY(10,5).

insert into Persons_1(lastname,firstname,Age)values('Ali','fahad',23)

--DATETIME - format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS
--SMALLDATETIME - format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS
--TIMESTAMP - format: a unique number

--Tip: To keep your queries simple and easy to maintain, do not use time-components in your dates, unless you have to!

create view [Product above avg price] As
select * from Product where Price > (Select  avg(price) from product)

select * from  [Product above avg price] 

--SQL Updating a View
--A view can be updated with the CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW statement.


--CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS
--SELECT column1, column2, ...
--FROM table_name

--SQL Injection
--SQL injection is a code injection technique that might destroy your database.

--SQL injection is one of the most common web hacking techniques.

--SQL injection is the placement of malicious code in SQL statements, via web page input.

--Look at the following example which creates a SELECT statement by adding a variable (txtUserId) to a select string. The variable is fetched from user input (getRequestString):

--Example
--txtUserId = getRequestString("UserId");
--txtSQL = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = " + txtUserId;

SELECT pid as UserId , Name as ProductName, city as Password FROM Product WHERE pid = 105 or 1=1;


SELECT pid as UserId , Name as ProductName, city as Password FROM Product WHERE pid = 6 or 1=1

select * from product


--SQL Injection Based on Batched SQL Statements 
--Most databases support batched SQL statement.

--A batch of SQL statements is a group of two or more SQL statements, separated by semicolons.

--The SQL statement below will return all rows from the "Users" table, then delete the "Suppliers" table.

--Example
--SELECT * FROM Users; DROP TABLE Suppliers
--Look at the following example:

--Example
--txtUserId = getRequestString("UserId");
--txtSQL = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = " + txtUserId;
--And the following input:

--User id: 
--105; DROP TABLE Suppliers

--The valid SQL statement would look like this:

--Result
--SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = 105; DROP TABLE Suppliers;

--txtUserId = getRequestString("UserId");
--txtSQL = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = " + txtUserId;
-- input 6; DROP TABLE Suppliers
select * from Product where pid = 6; DROP TABLE Persons  -- table deleted.

select * from Persons

--Use SQL Parameters for Protection
--To protect a web site from SQL injection, you can use SQL parameters.

--SQL parameters are values that are added to an SQL query at execution time, in a controlled manner.


--ASP.NET Razor Example
--txtUserId = getRequestString("UserId");
--txtSQL = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = @0";
--db.Execute(txtSQL,txtUserId);


--The SQL engine checks each parameter to ensure that it is correct for its column 
--and are treated literally, and not as part of the SQL to be executed.


--Another Example
--txtNam = getRequestString("CustomerName");
--txtAdd = getRequestString("Address");
--txtCit = getRequestString("City");
--txtSQL = "INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName,Address,City) Values(@0,@1,@2)";
--db.Execute(txtSQL,txtNam,txtAdd,txtCit);


--SELECT STATEMENT IN ASP.NET:

--txtUserId = getRequestString("UserId");
--sql = "SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CustomerId = @0";
--command = new SqlCommand(sql);
--command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@0",txtUserId);
--command.ExecuteReader();

--INSERT INTO STATEMENT IN ASP.NET:

--txtNam = getRequestString("CustomerName");
--txtAdd = getRequestString("Address");
--txtCit = getRequestString("City");
--txtSQL = "INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName,Address,City) Values(@0,@1,@2)";
--command = new SqlCommand(txtSQL);
--command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@0",txtNam);
--command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@1",txtAdd);
--command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@2",txtCit);
--command.ExecuteNonQuery();

--SQL Hosting
--If you want your web site to be able to store and retrieve data from a database, your web server should have access to a database-system that uses the SQL language.

--If your web server is hosted by an Internet Service Provider (ISP), you will have to look for SQL hosting plans.

--The most common SQL hosting databases are MS SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, and MS Access.

--MS SQL Server
--Microsoft's SQL Server is a popular database software for database-driven web sites with high traffic.

--SQL Server is a very powerful, robust and full featured SQL database system.


--The data type of a column defines what value the column can hold: integer, character,
--money, date and time, binary, and so on.

--SQL Data Types
--Each column in a database table is required to have a name and a data type.

--An SQL developer must decide what type of data that will be stored inside each column when
--creating a table. The data type is a guideline for SQL to understand what type of data
--is expected inside of each column, and it also identifies how SQL will interact with 
--the stored data.

--Note: Data types might have different names in different database. And even if the name
--is the same, the size and other details may be different! Always check the documentation!

--Data Types
--MySQL Data Types (Version 8.0)
--In MySQL there are three main data types: string, numeric, and date and time.
